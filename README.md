# Ragel Language Support
This extension provides basic ragel language support in Visual Studio Code.

### Features:

* Adds highlighting support of embeded ragel FSM definition codes.
* Adds frequently used code snippets.
* By default the targetting host language is C++, I am trying to make it configurable. Any ideas and inspirations are welcomed.
